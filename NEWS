* Changes in 0.2 (since 0.1.1)

** Bugfix: clean: handle nested subdirectories correctly.

   `hall clean' is supposed to recursively walk the project.  Prior to
   this, the walk would stope at the first subdirectory beneath the
   project root.  Now subdirectories should be walked in their
   entirety.

** Improve output of Makefile.am generator.

** Generate a fully-fledged test-driver.

   The test driver parses output from srfi-64 test files.  This means
   any such test files will now work out of the box with guile-hall.

   Thanks to Catonano for the suggestion, and Mathieu Lirzin for
   writing the original test-driver that we use in the project.

** Accept all error conditions when trying to fetch license.

   Should license fetching fail for any reason, then we just use a
   placeholder text.

** No longer assume we have a subdirectory with scheme files.

   This means guile-hall can be used to manage single script file
   projects.

* Changes in 0.1.1 (since 0.1)

** Add more default content for various files.

* Publication at 0.1
