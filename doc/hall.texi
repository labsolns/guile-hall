@chapter Introduction

Guile Hall is a program to manage the infrastructure with proper Guile
projects.  This means that any Guile project using Hall will be GNU
build system compliant; have tight integration with Guile's defacto
package manager, Guix; have access to utilities that make testing &
building Guile projects pleasurable.

Guile Hall is in early stages of development.  No guarantees are made
as to efficiency or elegance of code; nor do we guarantee API
stability.

This documentation is a stub.  Current documentation exists in the
README file.
